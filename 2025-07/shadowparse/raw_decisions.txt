(slip op., at 1).  the same is true on the facts presented here, where the consumer product safety commission exercises executive power in a similar manner as the national labor relations board, and the case does not otherwise differ from wilcox in any pertinent respect.

the district courtâs injunction was based on its view that executive order no. 14210, 90 fed. reg. 9669 (2025), and a joint memorandum from the office of management and budget and office of personnel management implementing that executive order are unlawful.  because the government is likely to succeed on its argument that the executive order and memorandum are lawfulâand because the other factors bearing on whether to grant a stay are satisfiedâ we grant the application.  we express no view on the legality of any agency rif and reorganization plan produced or approved pursuant to the executive order and memorandum.  the district court enjoined further implementation or approval of the plans based on its view about the illegality of the executive order and memorandum, not on any assessment of the plans themselves. those plans are not before this court.

with due regard for the deference owed to the executive branch in the conduct of foreign affairs. for its part, the government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps. the order heretofore entered by the chief justice is vacated.

the district courtâs injunction was based solely on the allegations of the nine non-profit-organization plaintiffs in this case. but under established law, those allegations are presently insufficient to support the organizationsâ standing. see, e.g., clapper v. amnesty intâl usa, 568 u. s. 398 (2013). this order does not address the claims of the other plaintiffs, which did not form the basis of the district courtâs preliminary injunction.
justice sotomayor would deny the application.
justice jackson would have declined to reach the standing question in the context of an application for emergency relief where the issue is pending in the lower courts and the applicants have not demonstrated urgency in the form of interim irreparable harm. see department of education v. california, 604 u. s. ___, ___ (2025) (jackson, j., dissenting) (slip op., at 1â2). thus, she would have denied the application.

pending before this court is the governmentâs application to vacate the tro.  dellinger has filed a response in opposition.  the government then filed a reply.  the question is thus fully briefed before this court.

although it acknowledges that this court typically does not have appellate jurisdiction over tros, the government urges us to construe the tro as a preliminary injunction or to exercise jurisdiction under the all writs act in light of the core executive power assertedly restrained.  application 31â32; see 28 u. s. c. â§1292(a)(1).  in his opposition, dellinger repeatedly notes that the tro will âexpire by its terms [in] eight [now five] days,â response in opposition 1, that it âlasts only for a very short duration,â id., at 15, and that it âis set to expire on february 26,â id., at 39. 

in light of the foregoing, the application to vacate the order of the united states district court for the district of columbia presented to the chief justice and by him referred to the court is held in abeyance until february 26, when the tro is set to expire.
